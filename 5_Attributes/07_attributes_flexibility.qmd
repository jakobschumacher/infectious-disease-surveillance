## Flexibility
A flexible public health surveillance system can adapt to changing information needs or operating conditions with
little additional time, personnel, or allocated funds. Flexible systems can accommodate, for example, new health-
related events, changes in case definitions or technology, and variations in funding or reporting sources. In
addition, systems that use standard data formats (e.g. in electronic data interchange) can be easily integrated with
other systems and thus might be considered flexible [5].
