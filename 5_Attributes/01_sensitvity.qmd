## Underestimation
Underestimation = unerascertainment + underreporting

## Sensitivity
What proportion of the true number of cases are counted

### How to measure
- Compare to gold standard

### How to improve
- Improve the detection
- Change case definition

### Example
- Imagine a case based system
- People that don’t go do a physician wont get reported


## External completeness
What proportion of the true number of diagnosed cases are counted ('sensitivity of reporting’)

### How to measure
- Capture-recapture

### How to improve
- Make notification obligatory
- Give incentives
- Do a sentinel system


### Example
- Lets assume a mortality surveillance system
- Doctors are required to fill out death certificates
- These death certificates are collected at a national level
- External completness means: of all deaths that are recognized by doctors how many get reported

## Internal completeness
- How complete is the information in our database

### How to measure
- Expected value of completeness vs actual value of completeness

### How to improve
- Improve the technical quality
- Teach

### Example
- Lets assume a mortality surveillance system
- We have ten records of deaths
- One of the records misses the age
- Three of them miss the probable cause of death
