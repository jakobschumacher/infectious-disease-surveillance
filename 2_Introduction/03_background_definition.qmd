subtitle: Surveillance is information for action!
---

The motto of public health surveillance ist information for action. This is also the shortest definition of surveillance but does not capture all elements. A history of the definitions can be found in the Article [The Past, Present, and Future of Public Health Surveillance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820481/table/tab5/) by Bernard Choi. The most influential definition is from Alexander Langumir that set out the path for the future definitions. >
