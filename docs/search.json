It explains what surveillance ist, how it is related with other similiar concepts, what the steps of a surveillance systems are and how to asses the quality of surveillance systems. The book is written for infectious disease experts in Europe, but can be used by anybody interested in the topic. It would be good to have some prior knowledge, but you dont need to.\nThe book consists of two parts",

    "text": "2.1 Neighbourhood surveillance\nNeighbourhood surveillance is the oldest form of surveillance. In its broadest sense it es people watching other people. Small Communities such as villages usually have a strong neighbourhood surveillance. Neighbors see and know everything what other neigbohrs are doing. This can be framed positively as in the saying: “it takes a village to raise a child” or negatively when people blaspheme other people.\nWith the widespread availability of cameras and the possibility to communicate directly this form of surveillance has gained a large momentum. The largely unsuccesfull Google glass project could have been an even larger driver of participatory surveillance. Now Surveillance becomes a tool that does not lie in the hands of a strong actor such as a state or less strong actors such as companies but in the hands of the individuals. This gives infectious disease specialists the opportunity to gather information from thos eindividuals as it is done in epidemic intelligence.\nThis form of surveillance is sometimes also called participatory surveillance - if you want to emphasize the empowerment of the people. One rather negative example of a participatory surveillance is vividly depicted in the book and film the circle. Sometimes this form of surveillance is called bottom-up-surveillance to emphasize the opposition to top-down-surveillance.",

This form of surveillance shows similar characteristics of the rhizom: is is being not directly visible (being “underground”)), it is horizontal in contrast to the top-down surveillance (like the rhizom that does not follow the typical direction of plants growing upwards to the sun)) and the surveillance is a group of different actors instead of one single responsible body. The surveillance done by the big tech companies is a form a rhizomatic surveillance. Collecting millons of datapoints that are left behind by users in the internet can give valuable inside that can be turned into profit. The cambridge analytica scandal is an example of such a surveillance system. State actors are of course also capable of doing rhizomatic survaillance as could bee seen in the documents leaked to PRISM.",

It is useful to be precise about the event that wants to be monitored. This helps in the communication and in the quality assessment.\nSurveillance systems are often named after the event that is monitored: Emergency room surveillance is one such example. Also the categorization of surveillance systems depends on the event being analyzed: For example, a system classified as “syndromic surveillance” is based on the monitoring of syndromes.\nA classic event that is monitored is the occurrence of an infectious disease in a person. However, there are many variations and other infection events that may be relevant:\n\nan available ICU bed\nthe colonization of a person by a pathogen\na physician’s ICD-10 classification of a patient\nthe discovery of a newspaper article about a disease outbreak\nthe subjective assessment of a public health department employee that something poses a threat to the population.\n\nOne important but sometimes difficult distinction is differing between infection and disease.

    "section": "12.2 Example of a case based surveillance system",
    "text": "12.2 Example of a case based surveillance system\nThe German infectious disease reporting system is governed by the Infection Protection Act (IfSG). It is the backbone of epidemiological surveillance in Germany. It has developed historically and has its roots in the Imperial Epidemic Act of 1900. This act hat for example the following regulation: “Any case of illness and any death from leprosy, cholera (Asian), typhus, yellow fever, plague (Oriental bubonic plague), smallpox […] must be reported immediately to the competent police authority.” The current reporting system was established in 2000 with the creation of the Infection Protection Act. The reporting system is legally regulated in Sections 6 to 11 of the Act, which have been amended multiple times, usually in response to acute events such as the HUS epidemic in 2011.\nThe events (Step 1) monitored are typically the occurrence of infectious diseases. However, the reporting system encompasses various reporting obligations and multiple reporting channels. It can therefore be viewed as a collection of related but essentially different surveillance systems. A significant component of the reporting system is the obligation for physicians, pathologists, and other professionals to report. The event captured in this context is the suspicion of a disease, the diagnosis of the disease, or the death from a diseases. The infectious diseases are laid out in the text of the law and consists out of severe diseases that can be medically diagnosed, such as measles, polio, or HUS. Another relevant component is the obligation for laboratories to report. The monitored event is a laboratory finding indicative of an acute infection. This laboratory reporting obligation applies to a wide range of infectious diseases. In addition to the physician and laboratory reporting obligations, there are other components, such as non-nominal reporting obligations for the laboratory detection of certain pathogens like HIV, which follow a separate reporting pathway.\nThe capture of physician and laboratory reports (Step 2) is usually carried out through the reporting process and investigations by the health authorities. For many years, the method of reporting was not standardized and was typically done via fax. In the last decade, the German Electronic Reporting and Information System (DEMIS) has been developed, primarily digitizing the reporting process from the reporter to the health authority. This method of reporting is now legally required for many reporting channels under the Infection Protection Act. The way health authorities conduct investigations is not prescribed, although there are, of course, restrictions due to privacy rights. A common investigation involves a phone call from the health authority and an infection control interview with the affected individuals. The reporting system is thus a hybrid system of passive and active surveillance. It is passive because the monitored events do not exist solely because of the reporting system. For instance, in most cases, a laboratory test is performed for clinical reasons, not for epidemiological reasons. It is active because health authorities actively investigate and contact the affected individuals. Investigation is a central part of the job profile for public health inspectors.\nThe classification (Step 3) within the reporting system is performed by the health authority, assisted by the respective reporting software. After entering the collected data, the software indicates whether the event matches the defined criteria. These definitions are twofold: first, there is a definition for events that must be reported to the state authority and the RKI (“reporting definition”), and second, there is a definition for cases officially counted in the RKI statistics (“reference definition”). Establishing these definitions is crucial for ensuring comparability and identifying increases or decreases in the number of cases. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government changed the case definition of COVID-19, leading to an artificial spike in the statistics. Case definitions can be sensitive, aiming to capture as many cases as possible, or specific, aiming to include only a small number of false-positive cases. Case definitions exist not only for a surveillance system but are also often established separately for outbreaks. Additionally, case definitions are not necessarily the standard for implementing measures. For example, in a suspected case of hemorrhagic fever, action does not need to wait until a case definition is met.\nData management (Step 4) takes place after classification. The reporting system has significantly benefited from more professional data management. Before the introduction of electronic reporting software, data was transmitted laboriously and prone to errors via mail or fax. With increasing digitization and the reduction of media disruptions, data management has become increasingly precise and faster. The most well-known reporting software, SurvNet, from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), sets the standards for transmission from the health authority to the state authority and from there to the RKI. Data management is carried out in databases operated by the RKI. This process includes quality assurance and data preparation for the subsequent evaluation step. The preparation also involves automated signal detection, identifying and appropriately displaying potential outbreaks.\nThe analysis of the reporting system’s data occurs at all three levels: local, state, and national. This is similar to the interventions taken. Usually the local agency takes case based measurements, whereas the state and the nation take population-based measurements\n\n\n\nScope of a case based surveillance system.

Through a defined system, relevant events are actively sought. An example of such surveillance is an expert commission that regularly meets to collect potentially relevant events. These events could be news reports or rumors heard by the experts. The collected events are then evaluated, and the critical information is passed on.",

A sentinel system saves resources and generally allows for more detailed information to be collected. The level of detail is often crucial for assessing epidemiological questions, such as evaluating the severity of a disease. For example, a few medical practices might be selected to collect detailed information on respiratory illnesses, including vaccination status, disease severity, and information on individuals without respiratory illnesses as a comparison group. These practices’ data can then be extrapolated to represent all medical practices. The alternative—examining all practices directly—is much more labor-intensive and risks lowering data quality because some information may be provided reluctantly.",
