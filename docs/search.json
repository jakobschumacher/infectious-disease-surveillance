They had to make tough decisions about measurements to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We dont know exactly what they were talking about but we can be certain that they were making the decisions with graph in picture 1 in mind. \nInfectious diseases are a threat to humanity: some have the ability to easily spread from one person to others persons and infecting all of mankind, some can be transmitted before the infectious persons knows that he is sick, some have no cure and a high fatality rate, some are able to spread long distances via air, water or food. Luckily no pathogen has evolved that ioncooperates all of those traits, but the threat remains.\nTo combat infectious diseases mankind has developed numerous techniques throughout the ages.\nOn very important tool that is a prerequisite to most count measures is infectious disease surveillance. Knowing what happens when and how is one of the cornerstonse of every response. And infectious disease surveillance does exactly that."

But i can also be other events as well: lab confirmation of a pathogen, free intensiv care beds, hospiatalisation because of a disease, vaccinations, death of person, a contact between to persons. One important but sometimes difficult distinction is differing between infection and disease. A lab confirmation usually shows an infection, which means that we know, that a person has a infection but is not necessarily sick, whereas a confirmation by a physician usually means that a person is sick.\nWhat event is monitored depends on the aim of the surveillance system. It is useful to be precise about the event that wants to be monitored. This helps in the communication and in the quality assessment.",
