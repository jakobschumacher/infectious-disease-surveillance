It explains what surveillance ist, how it is related with other similiar concepts, what elements a surveillance system is build of and how to asses the quality of surveillance systems. The books gives many examples\nWho should read this book: The book is written for infectious disease experts in Europe, but can be used by anybody interested in the topic. It would be good to have some prior knowledge, but you dont need to.\nLearning objectives: - Surveillance is information for action - Learn how to define a surveillance system - Get to know types of surveillance systems - Learn the steps of a surveillance system - Find resources about the evaluation\n\n\n\nQR-Code of the website\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820481/"

The way data is transmitted affects data quality and, consequently, the evaluation of the data. Data processing also includes the application of scripts that prepare the data for subsequent evaluation. An example is automated outbreak detection. Here, data is analyzed using an algorithm or machine learning to determine whether there is a high probability of an outbreak.

The surveillance done by the big tech companies is a form a rhizomatic surveillance. Collecting millons of datapoints that are left behind by users in the internet can give valuable inside that can be turned into profit.

A classic event that is monitored is the occurrence of an infectious disease in a person. However, there are many variations and other infection events that may be relevant: an available ICU bed, the colonization of a person by a pathogen, a physician’s ICD-10 classification of a patient, the discovery of a newspaper article about a disease outbreak, or the subjective assessment of a public health department employee that something poses a threat to the population.",

One important but sometimes difficult distinction is differing between infection and disease. A lab confirmation usually shows an infection, which means that we know, that a person has a infection but is not necessarily sick, whereas a confirmation by a physician usually means that a person is sick.\nWhat event is monitored depends on the aim of the surveillance system.

Classification is important because recorded events can be erroneous and should not be counted. Or there may not be enough information to decide whether a real event has occurred. Without classification, the events form an unclear collection with questionable significance. Classification is often a hidden part of the surveillance system or built into the system in a way that it is not recognized as such. For example, the application of case definitions in the reporting system is built into the reporting software.

In some cases, assessment is straightforward; for example, when a case of Ebola is reported in a returning traveler, it is clear that this is an important event that necessitates action. In other cases, assessment is highly complex and requires a lot of experience and exchange between the evaluators: Is a relative increase in a variant of SARS-CoV-2 a reason for action? This assessment step converts data into information, following the first two parts of the “data–information–knowledge–wisdom” pyramid. assessment is a subjective process and context-dependent. Knowledge of the limitations is particularly important for assessment. An increase in cases may seem like a clear event on paper but could be caused by intensified recording, making it less relevant and even a sign of relief, for example, if a comprehensive diagnostic of all hospital staff finds fewer cases than expected. The publication as open data means that the assessment is not only carried out by designated individuals but is open to everyone, enabling independent verification of this step in surveillance but also posing the risk of misinterpretation.",
