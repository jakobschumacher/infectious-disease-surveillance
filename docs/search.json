This can be framed positively as in the saying: “it takes a village to raise a child” or negatively when people blaspheme other people. A neighborhoodwatch\nWith widespread availability of cameras and the possibility to communicate directly the perticipatory surveillance has gained a large momentum. The largely unsuccesfull Google glass project could have been an even larger driver of participatory surveillance. Now Surveillance becomes a tool that does not lie in the hands of a strong actor such as a state or less strong actors such as companies but in the hands of the individuals.

The term comes from rhizom - the large underground network from Fungi. This form of surveillance shows similar characteristics of the rhisom: is is being not directly visible (being “underground”)), it is horizontal in contrast to the top-down surveillance (like the rhizom that does not follow the typical direction of plants growing upwards to the sun)) and the surveillance is a group of different actors instead of one single responsible body. The surveillance done by the big tech companies is a form a rhizomatic surveillance. Collecting millons of datapoints that are left behind by users in the internet can give valuable inside that can be turned into profit. The cambridge analytica scandal is an example of such a surveillance system. State actors are of course also capable of doing rhizomatic survaillance as could bee seen in the documents leaked to PRISM.",

Without classification, the events form an unclear collection with questionable significance. Classification is often a hidden part of the surveillance system or built into the system in a way that it is not recognized as such.

The way data is transmitted affects data quality and, consequently, the evaluation of the data. Data processing also includes the application of scripts that prepare the data for subsequent evaluation. An example is automated outbreak detection.

In other cases, assessment is highly complex and requires a lot of experience and exchange between the evaluators: Is a relative increase in a variant of SARS-CoV-2 a reason for action? This assessment step converts data into information, following the first two parts of the “data–information–knowledge–wisdom” pyramid. assessment is a subjective process and context-dependent. Knowledge of the limitations is particularly important for assessment. An increase in cases may seem like a clear event on paper but could be caused by intensified recording, making it less relevant and even a sign of relief, for example, if a comprehensive diagnostic of all hospital staff finds fewer cases than expected. The publication as open data means that the assessment is not only carried out by designated individuals but is open to everyone, enabling independent verification of this step in surveillance but also posing the risk of misinterpretation.",
