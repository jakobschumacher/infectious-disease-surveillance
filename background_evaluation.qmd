## Steps for an evaluation
Step 1. Plan the evaluation (why evaluate, find attributes to evaluate, engage stakeholders, find team, evaluation protocol)
Step 2. Describe the system (objectives, events, case definitions, population under surveillance, geography, data flow, interventions)
Step 3. Perform the evaluation (depends on attributes)
Step 4. Develop an action plan (give interventions)
