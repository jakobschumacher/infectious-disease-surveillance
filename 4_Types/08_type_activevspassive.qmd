---

Case based surveiallance systems can be divided whether they are active or passive. Many surveillancesystems have elements of both. 

## Active surveillance system
An active surveillance system involves a group of individuals who actively collect information for the surveillance system. 

An example of an active surveillance system would if the staff of an agency goes door-to-door to gather information. 

## Passive surveillance system
A passive surveillance system uses data collected for other purpose. Passive surveillance can be seen as secondary data analysis. 

An example for a passive surveillance system could be a system that extracts data from a hospital database.
