## Steps of an evaluation
1. Plan the evaluation
   a. Understand the trigger
   a. Engage stakeholders
   a. Decide on attributes
1. Perform the evaluation
   a. Start with a evaluation protocol
   a. Look at each attribute in its own way
1. Propose an action plan

## Typical triggers (1a)
- Missed outbreak
- Increased disease importance
- Occurrence of new public health event
- Cost saving
- Requirement to evaluate (IHR)
- New technology

## Engage the stakeholders (1b)
- Surveillance is a group effort
- Not like a science project

## Choose attributes (1c)
- Depends on the trigger
- Many attributes are costly

## Balance of attributes (1c)

## Evaluation protocol (2a)
- Its similar to a study protocol
- Important for coordination
- Important part: Describe the system

## Evaluate attributes (2b)
- Sensitivity: Get gold standard
- External completness: Capture-Recapture
- Internal completeness: Data analysis
- Timeliness: Data analysis
- Usefulness: Survey

## Propose an action plan (3)
- An evaluation is objective oriented 
- It should focus on improving the system
