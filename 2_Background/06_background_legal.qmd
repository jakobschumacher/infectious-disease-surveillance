title: "Laws and recommendations for surveillance"
---

Surveillance is firmly anchored in national and international legal systems. The International Health Regulations—one of the few nearly globally applicable frameworks—include articles that require surveillance from states. These articles aim to prevent cross-border threats from infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the value of such international collaboration became evident. There are currently efforts to supplement the International Health Regulations with an International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention. 

Surveillance is also a component of the “Essential Public Health Operations.” The goal of this fundamental component is to provide information and insights for health needs assessments, health impact assessments, and the planning of health services.
