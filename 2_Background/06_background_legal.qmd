## International health regulations

Surveillance is firmly anchored in national and international legal systems. The [International Health Regulations](https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations) (IHR) is a legally binding regulation for 196 countries. The IHR includes articles that require surveillance from the countries. The aim is to prevent cross-border threats from infectious diseases. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the value of such international collaboration became evident. 
New amendments of the IHR were adopted on the first of June 2024. It will come into place in 2025/2026.

## Essential public health operations
Surveillance is also a component of the [Essential Public Health Operations](https://who-sandbox.squiz.cloud/en/health-topics/Health-systems/public-health-services/policy/the-10-essential-public-health-operations). The essential public health regulations are a tool of WHO Europe and defines central tasks for public health institutes. The goal of this [surveillance component](https://who-sandbox.squiz.cloud/en/health-topics/Health-systems/public-health-services/policy/the-10-essential-public-health-operations/epho1-surveillance-of-population-health-and-wellbeing) is to provide information and insights for health needs assessments, health impact assessments, and the planning of health services.
