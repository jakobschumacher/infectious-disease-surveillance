AB  - BACKGROUND: To respond to the need to establish infodemic management functions at 
      the national public health institute in Germany (Robert Koch Institute, RKI), we 
      explored and assessed available data sources, developed a social listening and 
      integrated analysis framework, and defined when infodemic management functions 
      should be activated during emergencies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish a 
      framework for social listening and integrated analysis for public health in the 
      German context using international examples and technical guidance documents for 
      infodemic management. METHODS: This study completed the following objectives: 
      identified (potentially) available data sources for social listening and 
      integrated analysis; assessed these data sources for their suitability and 
      usefulness for integrated analysis in addition to an assessment of their risk 
      using the RKI's standardized data protection requirements; developed a framework 
      and workflow to combine social listening and integrated analysis to report back 
      actionable infodemic insights for public health communications by the RKI and 
      stakeholders; and defined criteria for activating integrated analysis structures 
      in the context of a specific health event or health emergency. RESULTS: We 
      included and classified 38% (16/42) of the identified and assessed data sources 
      for social listening and integrated analysis at the RKI into 3 categories: social 
      media and web-based listening data, RKI-specific data, and infodemic insights. 
      Most data sources can be analyzed weekly to detect current trends and narratives 
      and to inform a timely response by reporting insights that include a risk 
      assessment and scalar judgments of different narratives and themes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study identified, assessed, and prioritized a wide range of data sources for 
      social listening and integrated analysis to report actionable infodemic insights, 
      ensuring a valuable first step in establishing and operationalizing infodemic 
      management at the RKI. This case study also serves as a roadmap for others. 
      Ultimately, once operational, these activities will inform better and targeted 
      public health communication at the RKI and beyond.
