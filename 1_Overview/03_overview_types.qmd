## Syndromic surveillance
- Instead of a specific disease its a syndrom (a group of diseases) that is monitored
- Is more sensitive and can find unkown diseases

## Event-based surveillance
- This system detects unkown events
- It can be a group of persons who talk every week what they found

## Wastewater surveillance
- This system detects pathogens in wastewater 

## Mortality surveillance
- This events detects deaths (and sometimes the cause of deaths)

## Mass-gathering surveillance
- This type of surveillance monitors one specific mass gathering and uses a variety of techniques 

## Actvie vs. passive surveillance
- Some systems actively look for cases 
- Some systems are passive and collect secondary data

## Sentinel vs. comprehensive surveillance
- Some systems focus on a fraction of the population under surveillance - a sentinel
- Other systems try to capture everything in a population
