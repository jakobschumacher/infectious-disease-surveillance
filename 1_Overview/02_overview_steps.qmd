## 1. Infection event
- The event that is monitored can vary
- A typical event is an instance of an infectious disease - a case
- Strictly speaking the event is not part of the surveillance system

## 2. Collection
- Events are collected usally by system with an agency being one of the main actors

## 3. Classification
- The events are classified (see case definition)
- By classifing the events are turned into data


## 4. Data processing
- The data is processed in a data system that stores and distributes the data
- At this step data can be made as open data

## 5. Analysis

- Through the analysis the data is turned into information

## 6. Communication 
- The information is communicated to decision makers
- Usually done via reports
