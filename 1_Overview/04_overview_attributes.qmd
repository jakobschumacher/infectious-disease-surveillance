- Surveillance systems have attributes
- The definitions vary a lot
- This book follows ECDCs Handbook
- Other notable definitions: European medicines agency 
- Closely related is data quality (which is completeness and validity) 

## Underestimation
![Attributes around underestimation](../img/attributes_sensitivity.jpg)

### Sensitivity
- __Definition:__ _Proportion of cases in a population that are reported. Underascertainment and underreporting_
- __How to measure:__ Compare to gold standard, capture-recapture

### Positive predictive value
- __Definition:__ _proportion of real reported cases, divided by the total number of reported_
- __How to measure:__ Case-follow up

### Internal completeness
- __Definition:__ _the number of completed data fields out of the total number of data fields_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse the data

### External completeness
- __Definition:__ _whether the data reflect the true number of reported cases - 'sensitivity of reporting'_ This corresponds to underreporting
- __How to measure:__ Capture-recapture

## Validity

### Internal validity
- __Definition:__ _extent of errors within the system - 'errors in reporting'_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse the reporting system

### External validity
- __Definition:__ _whether the information recorded about the cases is correct_ 
- __How to measure:__ Test against a gold standard


## Timeliness
- __Definition:__ _speed between steps in a public health surveillance system_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse database

## Usefulness
- __Defintion:__ _contribution to the prevention and control of infectious diseases_
- __How to measure:__ Survey

## Representativeness
_ __Defintion:__ _accuracy of describing the occurrence of a health-related event across time, place, person__
- __How to measure:__ Population covered by surveillance divided by the total number

## Simplicity


## Flexibility


## Acceptability


## Balancing attributes
