subtitle: How can we characterise a surveillance system? 
---
# Attributes  {.unnumbered}

- Attributes are characteristics or properties of a system
- The definitions vary a lot
- This book follows [ECDC Handbook Data quality monitoring and surveillance system evaluation](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/Data-quality-monitoring-surveillance-system-evaluation-Sept-2014.pdf)
- Closely related is data quality (which is completeness and validity)

## Definitions around underestimation
![Attributes around underestimation](../img/attributes_sensitivity.jpg)


<br><br><br>


### Sensitivity
- __Definition:__ _Proportion of cases in a population that are reported. Underascertainment and underreporting_
- __How to measure:__ Compare to gold standard, capture-recapture


<br><br><br>



### Internal completeness
- __Definition:__ _the number of completed data fields out of the total number of data fields_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse the data


<br><br><br>


### External completeness
- __Definition:__ _whether the data reflect the true number of reported cases - 'sensitivity of reporting'_ This corresponds to underreporting
- __How to measure:__ Capture-recapture


<br><br><br>


## Validity

<br><br><br>


### Internal validity
- __Definition:__ _extent of errors within the system - 'errors in reporting'_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse the reporting system


<br><br><br>


### External validity
- __Definition:__ _whether the information recorded about the cases is correct_ 
- __How to measure:__ Test against a gold standard


<br><br><br>



## Timeliness

![Vocabulary of different time measurements](../img/attributes_timeliness.jpg)

- __Definition:__ _speed between steps in a public health surveillance system_
- __How to measure:__ Analyse database


<br><br><br>


## Usefulness
![Representaion of usefulness. What can you do with the information? Image done by bing image creator](../img/attributes_usefullness.jpg)

- __Defintion:__ _contribution to the prevention and control of infectious diseases_
- __How to measure:__ Survey


<br><br><br>


## Representativeness
- __Defintion:__ _accuracy of describing the occurrence of a health-related event across time, place, person_
- __How to measure:__ Population covered by surveillance divided by the total number


<br><br><br>


## Simplicity
- __Definition:__ _refers to both its structure and ease of operation._
- __How to measure:__ Survey 


<br><br><br>


## Flexibility
- __Definition:__ _the amount of adaptibility to changing information needs_
- __How to measure:__ Survey



<br><br><br>


## Acceptability
- __Definition:__ _Acceptability is the willingness of persons and organisations to participate_
- __How to measure:__ Survey


<br><br><br>
