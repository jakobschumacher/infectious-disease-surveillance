## Definition
>  Public health surveillance is the __systematic__ __ongoing__ __collection__, collation and __analysis__ of data for public health purposes and the __timely__ __dissemination__ of public health information for assessment and __public health response__ as necessary.
^[World Health Assembly 2005 (similar definition from Langmuir AD. William Farr: Founder of modern concept of surveillance. Int J Epidemiol 1973;5:13-8)]


## Other surveillance systems
1. Neighbourhood surveillance (People watching other people)
2. Rhizomatic surveillance (Unkown actors watching secretly)
3. Top-down-surveillance (State actors watching their people)

## Objectives

|Objective|Description|
|---|---|
|ALERT|Serves as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies|
|ACTION|Allows case based measures, group based measures, medical measures, community measures|
|EVALUATE|Documents the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals|
|DESCRIBE|Monitors and clarify the epidemiology of health problems|
|INFORM|Allows priorities to be set and to inform public health policy and strategies|


### Alert
- There are surveillance systems that are build to detect threats to human and animal health. 
- Surveillance systems that focus on this aspect usually have to be timely

### Action
- Surveillance systems are set up to open the possibilty to take action. 
- Case based measures are measures like information of cases and contacts or quarantine or isolation
- Group based measures are measures that affect a group of people. Examples are mask mandates
- Medical measures are measurements taken by health care personel. An example ist the substitution of an antibiotic drug with another because of a higher resistancy
- Community measures are measures taken by the people upon recieving information about an infectious disease. An example would be poeple starting to wear a mask if the SARS-CoV-2 incidence goes up

### Evaluate
- Interventions in public health should eventually have an impact. So if somebody was to launch a campaign for hygeinic cooking the impact could be measured in the campylobacter surveillance

### Describe
- Surveillance can serve as a basis for scientific research. The change of variants of a pathogen in relationship to vaccination is an example

### Inform
- In public health long term decisions about resources are made by politicians. Surveillance systems can guide those decisions.

## Examples
### Campylobacter
