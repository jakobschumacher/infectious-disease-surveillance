## Top-Down surveillance
The top-down surveillance is the "classic" form of surveillance. An actor - usually someone with power - watches over other actors. The watcher can be a school teacher watching over a class of students, or a hospital watching its patients or the police setting up CCTVs in the streets to detect crimes. The example of Jails watching there inmates become a symbol of surveillance with Bethams Panopticum

## Participatory surveillance
Participatory surveillance is the oldest form of surveillance. In its broadest sense it es people watching other people. Small Communities such as villages have a strong tendency to have a strong particpatory surveillance. Neighbors see and know everything what other neigbohrs are doing. This can be framed positively as in the saying: "it takes a village to raise a child" or negatively when people blaspheme other people.

With widespread availability of cameras and the possibility to communicate directly the perticipatory surveillance has gained a large momentum. The largely unsuccesfull Google glass project could have been an even larger driver of participatory surveillance. Now Surveillance becomes a tool that does not lie in the hands of a strong actor such as a state or less strong actors such as companies but in the hands of the individuals. This gives infectious disease specialists the opportunity to gather information from thos eindividuals as it is done in epidemic intelligence 

## Rhizomatic surveillance
Rhizomatic surveillance is a term coined by Haggerty and Ericson [@Haggarty] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11140886/). The term comes from rhizom - the large underground network from Fungi. This form of surveillance shows similar characteristics of the rhisom: is is being not directly visible (being "underground")), it is horizontal in contrast to the top-down surveillance (like the rhizom that does not follow the typical direction of plants growing upwards to the sun)) and the surveillance is a group of different actors instead of one single responsible body. 
The surveillance done by the big tech companies is a form a rhizomatic surveillance. Collecting millons of datapoints that are left behind by users in the internet can give valuable inside that can be turned into profit. The cambridge analytica scandal is an example of such a surveillance system. State actors are of course also capable of doing rhizomatic survaillance as could bee seen in the documents leaked to PRISM.
