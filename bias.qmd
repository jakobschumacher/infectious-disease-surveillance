## Definition of bias
Definition: Any systematic error in the design or implementation of an epidemiological study resulting in a conclusion which is different from the truth 

Any systematic error in design, conduct or analysis of study that results in mistaken estimate of an exposureâ€™s effect on risk of disease

- Unlike chance and confounding it cannot be quantified
- It can be minimized with the design and methodology of a study
- The effect of bias will be an estimate that is either above or below the true value, depending on the direction of the systematic error

## Chance

## Confounding
Confounding is a factor that influence both the cause and the effect of a causal relation

## Selection bias vs information bias

|Selection bias|Information bias|
|--|--|
|Systematic error in the selection of participants|Systematic error in the measurement of the exposure or outcome during data collection|
|Are the study participants the right people?|Have study participants been assigned to the right category? Is the information that we have about them correct / true?|

## Selection bias
Systematic error in the selection of participants


### Example for selection bias
- Aim: to assess mortality over 90 days in people with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection
- Target population: People living in Stockholm with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection 
- Who could you recruit? Examples:
   - Everyone with a positive test result recorded on the national health service database
   - People hospitalized for COVID-19 complications
   - Patients in a GP office with self-reported symptoms

### Different kinds of selection bias
- Sampling bias (more likely to be selected in a sample)
- Ascertainment bias (referal, admission, diagnostic)
- Participation bias (self-selection, non-responste, loss to follow up, survival, health worker)



## Information bias
Occurs when there are systematic differences in the way data on exposure or outcome are obtained from the various study groups 

### Missclassification
|Non-differential|differential|
|---|---|
|Random error|Systematic error|
|Misclassification of the exposure is EQUAL between cases & controls|Misclassification of the exposure DIFFERS between cases & controls|
|Misclassification of the outcome EQUAL  between exposed & non-exposed|Misclassification of the outcome DIFFERS between exposed & non-exposed|
|Weakens the measure of association|Weakens the measure of association|

### Different kinds of information bias
- Reporting bias (recall bias, prevarication, social desireability, instrument bias)
- Observer bias (interviewer bias, )


## How to deal with bias

### Where to deal with bias
- Careful consideration is needed in the design of the study
- Aim to prevent bias at the protocol stage
- It is not possible to correct for bias at the analysis stage

### If bias is present
- Account for it when interpretating results
- Discuss if the magnitude of the association was likely to be overestimated or underestimated


### Minimising bias

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Selection Bias
- Clearly define the study population
- Make explicit case, control, and exposure definitions
Take cases and controls from the same population (same possibility of exposure)
- Select controls from more than one source (eg hospital and community controls)
- For cohort studies, select exposed and non-exposed without knowing their disease status
- Use techniques to maintain follow-up

## Information bias
- Standardise measurement instruments
- Questionnaires + trained staff (validation/closed questions)
- Administer instruments equally to:
	 - cases/controls
	 - exposed/unexposed 
::: 


## Conclusion
- It is very difficult to reduce bias in observational studies
- Do not try to hide the bias
- Discuss the bias as a limitation and always consider in which direction it may have changed the associations
