Understanding the event is essential for understanding a surveillance system.The choice of events to monitor in a surveillance system is a critical decision that shapes the system's in many ways. The choice depends on the Objective of the surveillance system. \n\n- If a case-based intervention is intended the event that is monitored should be able to provide contact information of a case\n- If only goup-based intervention is inteded only a trend is needed which can be acquired by simpler systems\n- When the objective of a surveillance system is to monitor hospital capacity for resource allocation decisions, the events tracked should focus on specific indicators of hospital capacity and utilization like bed occupancy of staff coverage.\n\n## Naming and Categorization\nSurveillance systems are often named after the events they monitor. For example:\n\n- Emergency department surveillance (Emergency department visits)\n- Syndromic surveillance (based on monitoring syndromes)\n- Lab-based surveillance system (Reports by labs)\n- Meidasurveillance (Screening of media articles)\n\n## Typical events in infectious disease surveillance  \n- The occurence of an infectious disease\n- The occurence of an infection (infected person who is not necessarily diseased)\n- An available ICU bed\n- Self reports by people that they fell sick\n- The colonization of a person by a pathogen\n- A physician's ICD-10 classification of a patient\n- The discovery of a newspaper article about a disease outbreak\n- The subjective assessment of a public health department employee that something poses a threat to the population.\n- A social media signal detected by a software  \n\n\n",
