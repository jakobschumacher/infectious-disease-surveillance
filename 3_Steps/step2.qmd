title: "Step 2: Collection"

Infection events are collected How exactly this collection takes place depends on the specific surveillance system. This may happen, for example, through a report from a doctor. An event can also be recorded through a commissioned laboratory examination, such as a PCR test in wastewater. Other recordings are made by health authorities, which investigate further cases after an initial report. There is also the use of other data sources not primarily collected for surveillance, such as illness reports to health insurance companies or death certificates from doctors. This step also often leads to the naming of a surveillance system: a physician-based system as opposed to a laboratory-based system, or secondary data surveillance.
