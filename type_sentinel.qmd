title: "Sentinal vs comprehensive"
---

Sentinel surveillance is a system that does not monitor all individuals about whom conclusions are to be drawn but rather only a defined portion. The term "Sentinel," meaning "watchman," reflects this approach. A sentinel system saves costs and generally allows for more detailed information to be collected. The level of detail is often crucial for assessing epidemiological questions, such as evaluating the severity of a disease. For example, a few medical practices might be selected to collect detailed information on respiratory illnesses, including vaccination status, disease severity, and information on individuals without respiratory illnesses as a comparison group. These practices’ data can then be extrapolated to represent all medical practices. The alternative—examining all practices directly—is much more labor-intensive and risks lowering data quality because some information may be provided reluctantly.
